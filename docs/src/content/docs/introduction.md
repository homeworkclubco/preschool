description: Get started with Preschool, a minimal CSS framework and web component library
---

Preschool is a minimal, extensible CSS framework and web component library designed to be a starting point for your projects.

## Philosophy

Preschool is intentionally **barebones and unopinionated**:

- **Minimal styles** - Only the essentials to get started
- **Highly customizable** - Built to be extended and modified
- **Flexible** - Use what you need, leave what you don't
- **Hackable** - Simple, clean code that's easy to understand

## What's Included

### CSS Framework
- Design tokens using CSS custom properties
- Fluid spacing system (Utopia methodology)
- Minimal utility classes
- Basic CSS components (buttons, etc.)

### Web Components
Built with [Lit](https://lit.dev) for:
- Framework-agnostic usage
- Small bundle size
- Modern browser support

### Color Scheme System
Apply themes globally or to individual sections:
- Light (default)
- Dark
- Accent
- Extend with your own schemes

## Not Included

Preschool doesn't try to be everything. You won't find:
- Hundreds of pre-built components
- Opinionated design decisions
- Complex build requirements
- Kitchen sink functionality

This is by design. Preschool gives you the foundation to build your own design system.
