## Quick Start

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install preschool
```

Import and use:

```js
import 'preschool'
import 'preschool/styles'
```

```html
<button class="btn" data-variant="outline">
  Get Started
</button>

<ps-dropdown>
  <button slot="trigger" class="btn">Menu</button>
  <div slot="content">
    <a href="#">Option 1</a>
    <a href="#">Option 2</a>
  </div>
</ps-dropdown>
```

## Philosophy

Preschool is designed to be **extended, not used as-is**:

- Start with minimal styles
- Customize design tokens for your brand
- Add only the components you need
- Fork it if you want complete control

Think of it as a starter kit, not a finished product.
